                <h3>Things that I have learnt</h3>
                <p>&emsp;Programming has a reputation for being one of the most difficult disciplines to master.
                    Most people would feel programming language is very difficult to learn due to the complexity of the
                    instructions that computers comprehend and I was not an exception. Honestly, it was quite a
                    transition to me, from a non-technical background person to learning programming language from
                    scratch. Learning programming language is not as intimidating as it sounds. After learning computer
                    languages for a month, I now have the clearer concept on how a computer actually works and
                    understand the command from human. I also managed to learn about how to build a web page with HTML
                    and writing some codes in CSS to layout and design the web page.<br><br>
                    &emsp;Besides, the key skills of computational thinking allow me to work on my assessment in a more
                    efficient and effective way. I applied the concept of decomposition by dividing the whole assessment
                    task into multiple smaller tasks. I started with drafting my webpage layout in a piece of paper,
                    followed by creating and writing the content related to the questions and ended with designing and
                    structuring my webpage to a presentable view. Pattern recognition and abstraction by grouping the
                    similar content and hiding the unrelated information from my webpage. At last, I concluded with
                    algorithm design computational thinking skill by developing the webpage step-by-step according to
                    the flowchart that I drafted in initial stage.
                    Computational thinking skills are beneficial to me in every aspect. It helps me to understand the
                    problem better and derive solutions that are tailored to the questions. It also helps to ease my
                    workloads and reduce my working time significantly to develop a much efficient and effective
                    solution. <br><br>
                    &emsp;Upon completion of this assessment, I am confident that I have gained and equipped the
                    knowlodge and coding skills to be able to create and design a webpage that meets to the
                    requirements.
                </p>
                <h3>Impact on learning for the rest of course</h3>
                <p>&emsp;Nowadays, computational thinking is very crucial and it is the basic and fundamental knowledge
                    that every student must learn and apply to solve any problem. In applying computational thinking,
                    every student will be trained to behave like a problem solver, develop a growth mindset, collect and
                    analyze data from multiple sources, think critically and creatively to sort out the problems. Having
                    the right mindsets and skillsets will empower me to learn new knowledges and gain insights much
                    quicker from the rest of my courses. Towards the end of my masterâ€™s degree, I will have the ability
                    to perform problem solving skill with different programming languages. Persistency and determination
                    of continuous learning computer science with computational thinking skills will permit us to solve
                    real world problems in the future. </p>
