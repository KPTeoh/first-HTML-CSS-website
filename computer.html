                    <p>May 14, 1984 (age 38)</p>

                    <h3>Early Life</h3>
                    <p>Mark Zuckerberg was born in White Plains, New York in May 1984. He is one of the four children
                        and
                        the only son of Karen and Edward Zuckerberg. His mother is a psychiatrist while his father is a
                        dentist. Mark was really into computers and he developed an interest in computer programming
                        since
                        early age. He built a message network for his father’s dentist office called Zucknet so that the
                        receptionist could inform his dad of a new patient through the messaging program. (Mark Zuckerberg, 2019)</p>
                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>Mark is a model student who attended Philips Exeter College. He also earned several prizes in
                        science and classical studies in his junior year. After graduating from Exeter in 2002, Mark
                        gets enrolled in Harvard for the class of 2006 pursuing degrees in psychology and computer
                        science. Mark always wanted to connect with people, his goal was to create a community to bring
                        more people closer together. During his time at Harvard, he created a website called Facemash
                        which allowed students to share and rate photos. It was shut down by the university but it
                        inspired him to create Facebook. (Mark Zuckerberg, 2019)
                    </p>
                    <h3>Founding Facebook</h3>
                    <p>In February 2004, Zuckerberg launched “The Facebook” from his college dormitory with his college
                        roommates. At first their service was limited only to Harvard but later Zuckerberg decided to
                        expand
                        it to other schools. During his sophomore year in May 2004, Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of
                        Harvard
                        and relocated to Silicon Valley to complete his Facebook project. Mark stated the mission of
                        Facebook is to make the world open and connected.
                        At his age of 23, he became the world’s youngest self-made billionaire. In July 2010,
                        Zuckerberg
                        announced that the number of active users on the app has reached 500 million. He then was ranked
                        first on vanity fair’s list of the top 100 “Most Influential people of the information age”. In
                        October 2012, their number of active users has doubled to one billion-user milestone. (Mark
                        Zuckerberg, 2019)
                    </p>
                    <h3>Contributions</h3>
                    <p>Facebook acquired the photo and video sharing social media platform Instagram in 2012. Two years
                        later, the company acquired the mobile messaging app, Whatsapp. Today, Facebook is the most
                        widely
                        used social media platform. More than two billion people are Facebook users, roughly 37% of the
                        world's population. People from different countries are able to connect without meeting each
                        other.
                        This platform just provides people a voice and a place to become friends. It also helps
                        businesses
                        to build brands and engage with customers. (Downey.L 2022)
