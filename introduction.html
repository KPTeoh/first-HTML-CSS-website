                <h3>What is Computational Thinking?</h3>
                <p>&emsp;In this fast paced world, we are constantly facing new problem in our daily life. A complex
                    problem
                    would be difficult to crack and we cannot use the tools that we normally use to help solve the
                    problem. Without a proper strategy, it certainly would be difficult and possibly make it even harder
                    to solve. A common process of solving complex problems is known as computational thinking. It is the
                    thought processes involved in solving a problem and developing its solution by applying ideas,
                    concepts and methods in such a way that a computer, human or machine can effectively carry it out.
                </p>
                <h3>Key Concepts for Computational Thinking</h3>
                <p>Computational thinking involves four steps such as below:</p>
                <p><span class="bold">&#x2022 Decomposition:</span> Decomposition is the first step of computational
                    thinking process. Decomposition involves breaking a complex problem down into smaller and more
                    manageable parts. By dividing the problem into smaller parts, it allows us to understand the problem
                    better and develop effective solutions to tackle each part of the problem. </p>
                <p><span class="bold">&#x2022 Pattern recognition:</span> Second step of computational thinking process
                    is pattern recognition. Pattern recognition is simply identifying patterns or trends within a
                    problem that we might have encountered in the past and then apply what we have learned from it that
                    may help us to develop an effective solution. </p>
                <p><span class="bold">&#x2022 Abstraction:</span> Step 3 of computational thinking process is
                    abstraction. A complex problem is divided into smaller parts can be classified by identifying the
                    similar details that are related to the problem and disregarding unrelated information without
                    losing the important detail to work toward a solution. This is usually the hardest part of
                    computational thinking. </p>
                <p><span class="bold">&#x2022 Algorithm Design:</span> The final step of computational thinking process
                    is algorithm design. Algorithm design involves constructing the flowchart and developing
                    step-by-step instruction to solve the problem. The method can be used again to solve similar
                    problem.</p>
                <h3>Why is Computational Thinking Important?</h3>
                <p>&emsp; In today’s world, computational thinking influences every aspect of a modern business. Most of
                    the
                    business involve in collecting and analyzing data such as evaluating consumer’s behavior, storing
                    individual health data or tracking financial markets movements. A lot of jobs require problem solver
                    to make improvements to increase the efficiency of a business or making innovation products and
                    services for consumers. (Snalune.P, 2020)<br><br>
                    &emsp;Computational thinking skills are useful and valuable to jobs in every sector, including
                    banking and
                    investment firms, fast moving consumer goods, computer and software services, travel and leisure
                    industry, energy and manufacturing industry or public services such as healthcare, transportation,
                    education and law and regulatory.
                    Employees from respective field are required to demonstrate their computational thinking skills to
                    actively creating and solving problems. Those relevant skills can be applied to any role in public
                    or private sector and commercial business. (Cummins.K, 2022) For instances, computational thinking
                    skills can even be
                    applied on daily life such as cooking. Starting with decomposing cooking process into multiple steps
                    such as ingredients preparation, buying, washing and cutting. Followed by pattern recognition and
                    abstraction by categorizing the type of ingredients can or cannot be used for different dishes. The
                    final step would be cooking step-by-step.<br><br>
                    &emsp; Computational thinking can be applied on some real-world problems as well. For instances,
                    weather
                    forecasting is based on the past year weather history using patterns of generalization or
                    abstraction. Retail e-commerce site captures user journey to promote relevant information to the
                    users. This involves using decomposition techniques, dividing a problem down into its smaller parts
                    and formulating a strategic way to solve the problem using algorithmic thinking.<br><br>
                    &emsp; With computational thinking concept, we are able to come out with the solution to the problem
                    that may previously have seemed impossible to solve. It is a very efficient and effective skill to
                    equip and it will benefit us for life.
